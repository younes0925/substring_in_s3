# Find Substring in S3 Bucket

This script searches for a substring within text files in an S3 bucket, including files inside subfolders.

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket.
- Bash environment to execute the script.
- LocalStack installed and running if you are using it for local AWS services simulation.

## Instructions for Running the Script

### Make the Script Executable:
```
chmod +x find_substring_in_s3.sh
```

### Run the Script:

```
./find_substring_in_s3.sh <s3_bucket_name> <substring>
```

- Replace `<s3_bucket_name>` with the name of your S3 bucket.
- Replace `<substring>` with the substring you want to search for.

### Example Usage:

```
./find_substring_in_s3.sh my-test-bucket "search_term"
```

### Explanation of the Script:
- `list_all_files` Function:

    - Lists all files in the specified S3 bucket, including files inside subfolders.
    - Handles pagination to ensure all files are retrieved.

- `search_substring_in_s3` Function:

    - Downloads each text file from the bucket to a temporary directory.
    - Searches each file for the specified substring using grep.
    - Prints the names of files that contain the substring.
    - Prints a message if no files contain the substring.

- `main` Function:

    - Validates the input arguments.
    - Calls the search_substring_in_s3 function with the provided bucket name and substring.

### Features
- `Pagination Handling`: Ensures all files are retrieved even if they span multiple pages.
- `Text File Check`: Only processes files with a .txt extension.
- `Temporary Directory`: Uses a temporary directory to store downloaded files, which is cleaned up after the script runs.
- `User-Friendly Messages`: Prints informative messages, including a message when no files are found.


### Considerations for Production-Ready Code
- Error Handling:

    - The script includes basic error handling (e.g., checking the number of arguments).
    - Additional error handling can be added to manage AWS CLI errors and file operations more robustly.

- Efficiency:

    - The script uses a temporary directory to handle downloaded files, ensuring it doesnâ€™t clutter the filesystem.
    - It leverages grep for efficient substring searching.

- Maintainability:

    - The script is modular, with clearly defined functions for different tasks.
    - Comments are included to explain the purpose and functionality of each part of the script.

## Concepts:
### Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
- What is it?:
    - it is the ability to provision and support your computing infrastructure using code instead of manual processes and settings.

- Why would I want it?
    - `Consistency`: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
    - `Efficiency`: Automates setup and reduces manual effort.
    - `Version Control`: Allows tracking changes and rollback.

- Alternatives:

    - Manual Configuration: Error-prone and inconsistent.
    - Managed Services: Limits flexibility but reduces setup effort.

### Observability:
- In the context of microservices:
    - Observability is about monitoring and understanding the state of the system based on the data it generates.

- What do we want to observe?

    - `Logs`: Capture events and errors.
    - `Metrics`: Monitor performance indicators like response times and resource usage.
    - `Traces`: Track requests across services to identify bottlenecks.

- Challenges:

    - `Complexity`: Multiple interacting components.
    - `Data Volume`: High volume of logs and metrics.
    - `Correlation`: Difficulty in correlating data from different sources.    

- Solutions:

    - `Centralized Logging/Monitoring`: Use tools like ELK stack, Prometheus, and Grafana.
    - `Distributed Tracing`: Implement tools like Jaeger or Zipkin.
    - `Service Meshes`: Use Istio for built-in observability features.

### Security
- First three things to check in AWS infrastructure:

    - IAM Policies and Access Controls:

        - `Why`: Prevent unauthorized access.
        - `Check`: Ensure least privilege, audit roles, and rotate credentials.

    - Network Security:

        - `Why`: Protect resources from external attacks.
        - `Check`: Review VPC settings, security groups, and restrict unnecessary ports.

    - Data Encryption:

        - `Why`: Protect data at rest and in transit.
        - `Check`: Ensure encryption for S3, RDS, and communication channels using TLS/SSL.
